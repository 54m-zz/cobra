Cobra 0.1 Alpha Created By 54M

Cobra is a command line utility that can be used for a number of operations.
I, and I'm sure others as well, might consider it to be a pentesting tool.
One thing I would like to mention, is that it is still in alpha, so please use at own risk.
I am no responsible for your actions with this tool. (Even though the bruteforce sucks right now.)
The bruteforce option is basically crap right now, so just wait until I learn some more about Bash.
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTION OR FIND BUGS, PLEASE REPORT THEM AT MY GITHUB PAGE! https://github.com/54m/cobra
 Thanks!
